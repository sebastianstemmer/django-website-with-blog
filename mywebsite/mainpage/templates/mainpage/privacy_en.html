        <p class="privacy_top_p">Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed by us
          to the extent necessary
          and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the
          services offered there.</p>
        <p>Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter
          referred to as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection,
          recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use,
          disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination,
          restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.</p>
        <p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose,
          duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with
          others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve
          the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.</p>
        <p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
        <p>I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br>II. The rights of users and data subjects<br>III.
          Information about the data processing</p>


        <h3 class="privacy_subheading">I. Information about us as controllers of your data</h3>
        <p>The party responsible for this website (the "controller") for purposes of data protection law is:</p>

        <table id="privacy_table" class="table table-borderless">
          <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Name:</td>

            <td>contact.stemmer@gmail.com</td>
          </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>


        <h3 class="privacy_subheading">II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
        <p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the
          right</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being
            processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also
            Art. 15 GDPR);
          </li>
          <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
          <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further
            processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
          </li>
          <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to
            other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
          </li>
          <li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being
            processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such
          corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR.
          However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate
          effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.</p>
        <p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's
          future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data
          processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong></p>


        <h3 class="privacy_subheading">III. Information about the data processing</h3>
        <p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage
          ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or
          unless otherwise stipulated below.</p>

        <h4 class="privacy_subsubheading">Server data</h4>
        <p>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider will
          be collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and
          version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our
          site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.</p>
        <p>The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.</p>
        <p>The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement,
          stability, functionality, and security of our website.</p>
        <p>The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued storage is required for evidentiary
          purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until the investigation of the
          relevant incident is finally resolved.</p>

        <h4 class="privacy_subsubheading">Cookies</h4>
        <h5 class="privacy_subsubheading">a) Session cookies</h5>
        <p>We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on your
          computer by your browser. These cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your browser,
          location data, or IP address. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for example, to
          display our website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart function.</p>
        <p>The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are used to
          collect data to initiate or process contractual relationships.</p>
        <p>If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving
          the functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.</p>
        <p>When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.</p>
        <h5 class="privacy_subsubheading">b) Third-party cookies</h5>
        <p>If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we cooperate for the purpose of
          advertising, analyzing, or improving the features of our website.</p>
        <p>Please refer to the following information for details, in particular for the legal basis and purpose of such
          third-party collection and processing of data collected through cookies.</p>
        <h5 class="privacy_subsubheading">c) Disabling cookies</h5>
        <p>You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser
          to delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on
          the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for
          your browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent so-called flash cookies from
          being set. Instead, you will need to change the setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures required
          for this also depend on the Flash player you are using. If you have any questions, please use the help
          function or consult the documentation for your Flash player or contact its maker for support.</p>
        <p>If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the functions on our site may be fully
          usable.</p>

        <h4 class="privacy_subsubheading">Contact</h4>
        <p>If you contact us via email or the contact form, the data you provide will be used for the purpose of
          processing your request. We must have this data in order to process and answer your inquiry; otherwise we will
          not be able to answer it in full or at all.</p>
        <p>The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
        <p>Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and there is no further legal obligation
          to store your data, such as if an order or contract resulted therefrom.</p>

        <h4 class="privacy_subsubheading">Google Analytics</h4>
        <p>We use Google Analytics on our website. This is a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600
          Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (hereinafter: Google).</p>
        <p>Through certification according to the EU-US Privacy Shield</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active</a></p>
        <p>Google guarantees that it will follow the EU's data protection regulations when processing data in the United
          States.</p>
        <p>The Google Analytics service is used to analyze how our website is used. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1
          lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our
          site.</p>
        <p>Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time, or frequency of your visits to our
          website will be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored there. However, we use Google
          Analytics with the so-called anonymization function, whereby Google truncates the IP address within the EU or
          the EEA before it is transmitted to the US.</p>
        <p>The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of visits to our
          website and what visitors do once there. This data can also be used to provide other services related to the
          use of our website and of the internet in general.</p>
        <p>Google states that it will not connect your IP address to other data. In addition, Google provides further
          information with regard to its data protection practices at</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners,</a>
        </p>
        <p>including options you can exercise to prevent such use of your data.</p>
        <p>In addition, Google offers an opt-out add-on at</p>
        <p><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>
        </p>
        <p>in addition with further information. This add-on can be installed on the most popular browsers and offers
          you further control over the data that Google collects when you visit our website. The add-on informs Google
          Analytics' JavaScript (ga.js) that no information about the website visit should be transmitted to Google
          Analytics.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, you can <a href="javascript:gaOptout()">click here</a>, to deactivate Google Analytics.</p>
        <p>However, this does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analytics
          services we may use as detailed herein.</p>

        <h4 class="privacy_subheading">Google Fonts</h4>
        <p>Our website uses Google Fonts to display external fonts. This is a service provided by Google Inc., 1600
          Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (hereinafter: Google).</p>
        <p>Through certification according to the EU-US Privacy Shield</p>

        <p>Google guarantees that it will follow the EU's data protection regulations when processing data in the United
          States.</p>
        <p>To enable the display of certain fonts on our website, a connection to the Google server in the USA is
          established whenever our website is accessed.</p>
        <p>The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the optimization and economic
          operation of our site.</p>
        <p>When you access our site, a connection to Google is established from which Google can identify the site from
          which your request has been sent and to which IP address the fonts are being transmitted for display.</p>
        <p>Google offers detailed information at</p>
